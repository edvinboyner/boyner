Reducers - specify how the application's state changes in response to
actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe what 
happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

Vi har olika reducers men samlar alla via rootReducer där vi använder combineReducer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Store holds the whole state tree of your application. 
The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.
A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it.
To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.

I configureStore.js skapar vi storen. I Root.js kör vi configureStore
för att underlätta så vi slipper skriva så mkt kod i configureStore.

I slutet av vissa klasser kör vi connect(). Detta är en funktion
som returnerar en komponent med högre ordning som tar in det som är i ().

mapStateToProps:

This function takes in the state of our store (we have access to that).
Then we return an object and this object is going to represent which properties
are attached to the props of this component. So then we can access them 
inside this comopnent.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Action:
We dispatch an action and this calls an action creator to generate that 
creator. Redux thunk will allow us not to return an action creator but
to return a function. Inside that function we can halt the dispatch. 
We pause it for a second. Then we perform an asynchronous request 
(like, go grab some data or update some data). Then we can resume
the dispatch and pass it to the reducer once this async requerst has
been completed.

So: The component will still dispatch an action nas normal and call an 
action creator as normal, but inside the action creator thats where
we halt the process we return a function instead of an action, like we 
normally would, and then we go out and grab data (or update or whatever)
then resume the dispatch and pass it to the reduce of the action. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this could take in a list of middleware.
it turns into a store enhancer so we could add many different middlewares
inside here and we could also have many different store enhancers here.
And they enhance the store functionality. 
We have now applied this tunkMiddleware which is now enchancing our
store with extra functionality, that functionality now being that we 
can return a function inside our action creators which can then
interact with a database. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firestore is a no SQL database and it deals with collection and documents.
Collection: is a collection of documents that belong together 
(for example on our project a collection would be Todos and in that Todos-collection
we would have a series of different documents and each one of these documents
would be a single todoItem. )
Document: Looks very much like a JS object. It has key value pairs.
The key could be a title and the value would be a string.
